Getting started
---------------

To get started with Android/StealthOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) and [Version Control with Git](https://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

To initialize your local repository using the StealthOS trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u git://github.com/Stealth-OS/platform_manifest -b 11
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync --force-sync --no-clone-bundle
```
